<h1>Documenting branch strategy and ci/cd implications</h1>

<p>The goal of this approach is as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Trunk based development - Develop features agains a master branch</li>
    <li>Integrate with main branch using Pull Requests to merge a feature brach</li>
    <li>Main branch can be merged to all lower environments including pre-prod</li>
    <li>Create a release brach for testing in pre-prod / migration to production</li>
    <li>Any fixes committed to release branch should also be committed to master</li>
    <li>Ideally release branches would have additional restrictions / approvals</li>
</ul>

<p>Development Process (System / UAT)</p>

<ul>
    <li>Developer creates a feature branch for feature development</li>
    <li>After change and tests are implemented, push branch to remote (can push before)</li>
    <li>Raise a PR to merge feature branch to master</li>
    <li>Code will automatically be migrated to system environment and manually migrated to UAT</li>
    <li>Code can be pushed from master to pre-prod if NOT in a code freeze</li>
    <li>Use current approach in GitHub Actions to migrate to UAT</li>
</ul>

<p>Testing / Deployment Process (Pre-Prod / Production)</p>

<ul>
    <li>On GitHub - Create a release branch from master</li>
    <li>Naming convention will be "release/release-master-1.0.0</li>
    <li>Minor version committed for every release branch, major version committed for breaking changes / large changes</li>
    <li>Can migrate to pre-prod at this point - the GitHub action will read the version from the branch name</li>
    <li>If fixes / changes made to the release branch, then will need to tag the commit before migrating again</li>
    <li>The tag should indicate the new version for the artifacts with a new patch number</li>
    <li> > git tag 1.0.1 release/release-master-1.0.0</li>
    <li> > git push origin 1.0.1</li>
    <li>Now can migrate to pre-prod again - the GitHub action will find the tag to generate the artifacts version</li>
</ul>

<p>The GitHub action will have to be written to use a gitversion extension and we will include a Gitversion.yml file in each project to configure our desired versioning strategy.</p>
